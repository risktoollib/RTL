\description{
This model applies Kirk's (1995) closed-form approximation to
price spread options, assuming the spread \eqn{F_2 - F_1} is approximately
log-normal. Unlike Kirkâ€™s original ratio-based formulation, the model uses
the numeric difference of the forward prices \eqn{F_2 - F_1} to facilitate
direct comparisons with numeric strike prices and barriers. The model
incorporates adjustments for barriers (up-and-out, down-and-out, etc.) by
reflecting the spread's log-normal distribution and applying a correction
term for breached barriers.
