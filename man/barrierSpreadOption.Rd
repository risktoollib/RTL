\description{
Computes the price and Greeks of European barrier spread options using an extension
of Kirk's 1995 approximation following Bjerksund & Stensland (2011) approach.
Supports both call and put options with various barrier types and monitoring approaches.
}
\details{
The function implements a barrier version of Kirk's approximation for spread options.
It includes support for different barrier types and monitoring approaches:

Barrier Types:
\itemize{
\item Down-and-out ("do"): Option becomes worthless if asset price hits barrier from above
\item Down-and-in ("di"): Option activates when asset price hits barrier from above
\item Up-and-out ("uo"): Option becomes worthless if asset price hits barrier from below
\item Up-and-in ("ui"): Option activates when asset price hits barrier from below
}

Monitoring Approaches:
\itemize{
\item Continuous: Traditional continuous barrier monitoring
\item Discrete: Monitoring at specific intervals with Broadie-Glasserman-Kou adjustment
\item Terminal: Barrier condition checked only at expiry
}
}
\examples{
# Price a down-and-out call barrier spread option
F1 <- 100    # Forward price of first asset
F2 <- 110    # Forward price of second asset
X <- 5       # Strike price
B <- 95      # Barrier level
sigma1 <- 0.2   # Volatility of first asset
sigma2 <- 0.25  # Volatility of second asset
rho <- 0.5      # Correlation between assets
T2M <- 1        # Time to maturity (1 year)
r <- 0.05       # Risk-free rate

# Price with continuous monitoring
result <- barrierSpreadOption(
  F1 = F1, F2 = F2, X = X, B = B,
  sigma1 = sigma1, sigma2 = sigma2,
  rho = rho, T2M = T2M, r = r,
  type = "call",
  barrier_type = "do",
  monitoring = "continuous"
)

# Price with discrete (daily) monitoring
result_discrete <- barrierSpreadOption(
  F1 = F1, F2 = F2, X = X, B = B,
  sigma1 = sigma1, sigma2 = sigma2,
  rho = rho, T2M = T2M, r = r,
  type = "call",
  barrier_type = "do",
  monitoring = "discrete",
  monitoring_freq = 252
