\arguments{
\item{F1}{numeric, the forward price of the first asset}

\item{F2}{numeric, the forward price of the second asset}

\item{X}{numeric, the strike price of the spread option}

\item{B}{numeric, the barrier level for the spread (F2 - F1)}

\item{sigma2}{numeric, the volatility of the second asset (annualized)}

\item{rho}{numeric, the correlation coefficient between the two assets}

\item{T2M}{numeric, the time to maturity in years}

\item{r}{numeric, the risk-free interest rate (annualized)}

\item{type}{character, type of option ("call" or "put")}

\item{barrier_type}{character, type of barrier ("do" for down-and-out, "di" for down-and-in,
"uo" for up-and-out, "ui" for up-and-in)}

\value{
A list containing the option price and Greeks
}
\description{
Computes the price and Greeks of European barrier spread options using an extension
of Kirk's 1995 approximation. The barrier condition is applied to the spread (F2 - F1)
rather than individual asset prices.
